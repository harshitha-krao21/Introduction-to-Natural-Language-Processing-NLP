# Introduction-to-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-
This project will dive into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing. It guides through basic preprocessing techniques, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis. By applying your NLP skills, we can predict the rating of a review.

# Introduction to NLP Techniques

Preprocessing Techniques: These are the foundational steps to prepare textual data for analysis.

Removing Stop Words: Common words (e.g., 'and', 'the', 'is') that are usually filtered out before processing.

Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., 'running' to 'run').

Vectorization: Converting text into numerical format using CountVectorizer or TFIDF.

Topic Modeling: A type of statistical model for discovering abstract topics within a collection of documents. One popular method is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (Page.342).

Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, typically categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral.

# Overview

# Preprocess the Text Data:

Remove stop words

Perform lemmatization

Use CountVectorizer to vectorize the text

# Run Topic Modeling and Sentiment Analysis:

Use LDA to identify topics in the reviews

Use a pre-trained model to extract the sentiment of each review

Train a Predictor for Rating:

# Use the preprocessed and feature-extracted data to train a model that predicts the rating of a review

You can freely experiment with different models and techniques to improve your prediction accuracy e.g. linear regression or logistic regression

Compare and Interpret the Results:

# Evaluate your model's performance on your data set (report traing and testing metrics)

Document your observations

# Data Description

The dataset reviews_data.csv contains information on customer reviews, including the reviewer's name, location, date of review, rating, review text, and associated images. This dataset can be utilized to explore various NLP techniques such as preprocessing, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis.

The objective is to preprocess the textual data, perform topic modeling and sentiment analysis, and finally use the extracted features to predict the rating of a review.

# Data Attributes

name: Name of the reviewer.

location: Location of the reviewer.

Date: Date the review was posted.

Rating: Rating given by the reviewer (e.g., 5.0, 4.0).

Review: Text of the review.
